Laws and regulations related to data retention policies vary depending on the country, industry, and the type of data being handled. The following are some (not exhaustive) of the largest regulations, acts, and laws that apply to data retention policies.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>It's important for your organization to carefully review the relevant laws and regulations applicable to their specific circumstances and seek legal advice to ensure compliance with data retention requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, fines, and reputation damage.</p> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) GDPR is a European Union regulation that governs the protection of personal data of EU citizens. It mandates strict requirements for the collection, storage, and processing of personal data, including specific provisions regarding data retention periods and purposes. While GDPR does not set a strict retention period, it specifies that organizations are obliged to publish and enforce retention policies. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) CCPA is a state-level privacy law in California, USA, which grants California residents certain rights over their personal information held by businesses. It includes requirements for businesses to disclose data retention practices and allow consumers to request deletion of their personal data. ISO/IEC 27001 The International Organization for Standardization ISO/IEC 27001 framework is an international standard requiring organizations to adhere to maintain data logs for a minimum of three years to ensure data security and mitigate potential regulatory penalties. Additional requirements include strict data access control, data disposal including the use of encryption, shredding, or other secure deletion methods (such as Retention Manager for Confluence). Data retention policies under ISO/IEC 27001 should clearly define the purposes for which data is collected and retained and ensure that data is not retained beyond what is necessary for those purposes. Additionally in ISO/IEC 27001 data retention policies should be subject to regular review and audit to assess compliance with policy requirements and identify areas for improvement. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) HIPAA is a US federal law that sets standards for the protection of sensitive patient health information (PHI). HIPAA includes provisions for data retention and disposal of PHI by covered entities such as healthcare providers and health insurers. While HIPAA does not define a strict data retention period, it specifies a minimum retention period of six years for communications containing PHI. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) SOX is a US federal law aimed at improving corporate governance and financial reporting transparency. It includes requirements for the retention of financial records and communications, including electronic records, to ensure accountability and prevent fraud. Within SOX are differentiated retention period requirements based on the data type itself. Typically accounting ledgers must be retained for seven years, invoices require five years of retention, and payroll or bank records require indefinite retention. Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires a data retention period of three years for contractors and federal agencies of the United States Government. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) PCI DSS is a set of security standards designed to ensure the secure handling of credit card information by businesses that process, store, or transmit payment card data. It includes requirements for data retention and secure disposal of cardholder data. PCI DSS Requirement 3.1 for example, defines an appropriate retention and disposal period to limit the storage of consumer payment data only to the extent needed for legal, regulatory, or business justifications and that post-authorization storage of sensitive authentication data is prohibited. Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) ECPA is a US federal law that governs the privacy of electronic communications, including email and electronic records. It includes provisions related to data retention and disclosure of electronic communications by service providers. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) COPPA is a US federal law that imposes requirements on websites and online services that collect personal information from children under the age of 13. It includes provisions for data retention and parental consent. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, SI-12, recommends organizations \"manage and retain information within the system and information output from the system in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines and operational requirements.\" Under NIST, organizations should set retention policies to content under NIST that extends through the lifecycle of the data or product itself. Data Protection Laws of Other Jurisdictions In addition to the above, companies may need to comply with various data protection laws and regulations in other jurisdictions where they operate or where their customers are located. For example, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore. <p>Warning</p> <p>If your organization falls into an industry or does business with an organization in public utilities, banking, government, finance, or health care, you are more likely required to publish and strictly enforce a data retention policy and deploy a service such as Contention Retention Manager for Confluence.</p>"},{"location":"kb/data-retention-policies-and-management-best-practices/","title":"Data Retention Policies and Management Best Practices","text":"<p>When developing a data retention policy for your company, the following best practices help make sure your policy is effective, compliant with relevant laws and regulations, and aligned with your business objectives. Here are some key best practices to consider.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>We recommend you review all policies, practices, and processes related to this app with your company\u2019s legal representative before you begin enforcing any retention policies. This will help you remain compliant with any applicable laws or regulations.</p> Understand Legal and Regulatory Requirements Begin by understanding the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to your industry and the type of data you handle. This includes laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations. Ensure that your data retention policy complies with these requirements. Review our section on Data Retention Laws and Regulations to get started. Identify Data Types and Classify Data Identify the types of data your company collects, processes, and stores. Classify data based on its sensitivity, importance, and regulatory requirements. This classification will help determine appropriate retention periods and security measures. Within Confluence the data types can be blog posts or pages, but the context of each page or blog post may require a specific type of data classification; an example would be a Confluence Page containing company working policies and Human Resources information. Retention Manager for Confluence can help you set content specific retention periods with our Policy Extension feature. Define and Publish Retention Periods Establish clear guidelines for how long different types of data should be retained based on legal requirements, business needs, and industry best practices. Consider factors such as the purpose of data collection, statutory limitations, and potential litigation or audit requirements. Implement Secure Storage and Access Controls Implement appropriate security measures to protect retained data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. This may include encryption, access controls, authentication mechanisms, and physical security measures for storage facilities. Retention Manager for Confluence will help you with the process of secure storage and access control. Establish Data Disposal Procedures Develop procedures for the secure disposal of data when it reaches the end of its retention period or is no longer needed for business or legal purposes. Ensure that data is securely erased, purged, shredded, or anonymized to prevent unauthorized access or recovery. Retention Manager for Confluence provides an option for automated purging of content based on retention periods ending. When content is purged from Retention Manager for Confluence, it is not recoverable to the organization. Document Policies and Procedures Document your data retention policy and associated procedures in a clear and accessible manner. Ensure that employees understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing the policy and provide training as needed. Regularly Review and Update the Policy Data retention requirements may change over time due to evolving regulations, changes in business practices, or technological advancements. Regularly review and update your data retention policy to ensure it remains current and effective. Conduct Audits and Assessments Periodically audit your data retention practices to ensure compliance with the policy and relevant regulations. Identify any areas of non-compliance or potential risks and take corrective actions as needed. Monitor and Measure Compliance Establish mechanisms for monitoring and measuring compliance with the data retention policy. Regularly assess compliance metrics and address any issues or deviations promptly. Retention Manager for Confluence provides an Audit Log which retains a record for policy updates, content extensions, and a record for content that was purged in a manner that helps comply with ongoing audits and assessments. Involve Stakeholders Engage stakeholders from across the organization, including legal, IT, compliance, and business units, in the development and implementation of the data retention policy. Ensure that the policy reflects the needs and priorities of all stakeholders. <p>By following these best practices, your company can develop a data retention policy that effectively manages data while ensuring compliance, security, and alignment with business objectives. Regular review and updates will help ensure that the policy remains relevant and effective in addressing evolving data management needs and regulatory requirements.</p>"},{"location":"kb/how-to-build-a-data-retention-practice/","title":"How to Build a Data Retention Practice","text":"<p>When crafting a data retention policy, it is essential to recognize that each organization has distinct requirements such as based on where you operate, where you collect revenue, or what industry you operate in. There are several universally recognized best practices on developing an organization data retention policy, these are suggestions to help you get started.</p> Assemble an Expert Team Establishing a comprehensive retention policy demands collaboration from various internal departments, including legal, finance, and accounting. If in-house expertise is limited, consider engaging consultants or contractors. Ensure the team includes professionals well-versed in data retention standards and practices. Determine Essential Data Begin by cataloging all organizational data, understanding what is crucial to retain. This entails considering both industry-specific regulations and your operational needs. Sometimes, business imperatives might necessitate longer retention than legal mandates. Distinguish Data Types Not all data carries the same value. Refrain from adopting a one-size-fits-all retention policy. Instead, define specific categories of data and assign tailored retention durations to each. Prioritize Data Protection Embed robust protective measures within the policy to thwart breaches and unauthorized access. This can include encryption, physical safeguards, and data loss prevention tools. Prevention is always more cost-effective than post-breach remediation. Incorporate Mobile Device Protocols In our \"bring your own device\" era, it is imperative to account for data on personal devices. Solutions like remote data wiping can be instrumental when these devices are misplaced. Monitor User Activity Utilize tools to observe user interactions with data, facilitating detection of suspicious behaviors and ensuring policy adherence. For instance, if an individual attempts to access soon-to-be purged data, these systems can intervene and alert administrators. Plan for Legal Holds If litigation arises, organizations should have mechanisms to pause automatic data deletions, preserving subpoenaed information. Oversee Third-party Vendors Extend your policy's reach to vendors accessing your data. Contractual agreements should clearly define their data protection responsibilities, coupled with regular compliance monitoring. Draft Two Policy Versions For organizations under regulatory scrutiny, it is beneficial to have a detailed, legally-compliant version of the policy and a simplified internal version to ensure broader understanding across stakeholders. Educate the Workforce It is crucial that every staff member understands the policy, especially those frequently interacting with data. They should be familiar with retention durations, access protocols, and purging procedures. Annual Policy Review Regularly revisit and update the policy to stay abreast of evolving regulations and technological advancements, ensuring its continual relevance and efficacy. <p>Remember, a robust data retention policy not only ensures compliance but also fortifies the organization against potential threats and liabilities.</p>"},{"location":"kb/the-importance-of-information-governance/","title":"The Importance of Information Governance","text":"<p>As part of an ongoing effort to help demystify information governance, Opus Guard is committing to building product which help your organization build, audit, and enforce data retention policies.

At its core, it revolves around the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Let's delve briefly into each aspect:</p> Confidentiality Information governance dictates the implementation of measures to restrict access to sensitive data only to authorized personnel. This involves employing encryption, access controls, and user authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Integrity Maintaining data integrity is paramount to ensure its accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Information governance involves establishing protocols for data validation, error detection, and correction to mitigate the risk of data manipulation or corruption. Availability Information must be readily accessible to authorized users whenever needed. Information governance strategies include redundancy, disaster recovery planning, and backup systems to minimize downtime and ensure uninterrupted access to critical data. <p>The importance of information governance extends across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and government, where regulatory compliance and data privacy regulations impose stringent requirements on data handling practices. Non-compliance can lead to severe repercussions, including legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.</p> <p>Effective information governance requires a holistic approach, encompassing technological solutions, organizational policies, and employee training. It involves collaboration across departments, from IT and legal to compliance and risk management, to establish a cohesive framework that aligns with business objectives while mitigating risks.</p> <p>Information governance serves as the linchpin of modern-day data management strategies, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational data assets. By proactively addressing data governance challenges with Content Retention Manager for Confluence, organizations can unlock the full potential of their data while safeguarding against potential threats and vulnerabilities.
