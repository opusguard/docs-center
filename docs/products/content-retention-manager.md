# Content Retention Manager for Confluence

## Introduction

Retention Manager for Confluence is a retention service for organizations who use Confluence. Retention Manager makes it easy for teams to track all content across Confluence against the organization’s defined data retention policies. Our app helps teams across Legal, Human Resources, and IT easily manage how long content is stored or retained across Confluence instances. This app is incredibly powerful; with the ability to index all data and purge (irreversibly remove) content in bulk actions.

### How it works

Retention Manager focuses on information governance for Confluence falling into two basic categories retention and removal.

**:file_folder: Retain content on Confluence for as long as you need it.**
: You can retain content for a set or indefinite time. Content remains available to admins even when a user archives or deletes the page or blog.

**:material-trash-can-outline: Remove content on Confluence when you no longer need it.**
: You can purge content from Confluence when it is no longer needed. Once purged, content cannot be recovered by admins or users.

### Data Management within Content Manager

Content Manager for Confluence sits directly on your Confluence instance and does not retain any data, content, or user information on external systems. The service is wholly contained within your cloud instance. When content is purged by Content Manager, it cannot be recovered by users or admins.
